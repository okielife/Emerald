# Emerald

This repo will store a variety of things related to my house modeling effort.  Folders include:
- energyplus: This is the EnergyPlus specifics, the IDF input file, the EPW weather file, any other stuff.
- geometry: This includes the canon geometry for the house, including DXF files and other resources.
- pyemerald: As a part of this work I'm sure I'll end up making a bunch of Python code, it goes here, probably.
- web: This is a Django website which will eventually show off the model really nicely, including showing renderings, results, etc.
