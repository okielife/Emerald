# Emerald

This repo will store a variety of things related to my house modeling effort.  Folders include:
- docs: Sphinx-based docs that are to be built by ReadTheDocs, should cover all this work.
- energyplus: This is a sort of "bin" directory, where it will contain an updated version of the IDF and EPW files, among other built up resources.
- pyemerald: There are a bunch of different areas of data being processed as a part of this, including weather data, geometry, schedules, validation data, and many others.  Python code related to mining/processing this data lives here.  The code that actually creates the final IDF and EPW files lives in here.
