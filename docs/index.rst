Welcome to Emerald Modeling's documentation!
============================================

Hi, I am here.
Here are some things we've done so far:

 - Extremely detailed measurements of the house floor plan, then height measurements
 - Gotten electricity usage data from bills
 - Estimated thermal properties of the envelope
 - Generated basic EnergyPlus inputs
 - It runs EnergyPlus 9.3 on GitHub Actions now

Still to do:

 - Move to EnergyPlus 22.1; update for API changes
 - Add outputs as individual classes, separate out all boilerplate stuff
 - Diagnose energy usage difference
