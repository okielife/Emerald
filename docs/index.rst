Welcome to Emerald Modeling's documentation!
============================================

Hi, I am here.
Here are some things we've done so far:

 - Extremely detailed measurements of the house floor plan, then height measurements
 - Gotten electricity usage data from bills
 - Estimated thermal properties of the envelope
 - Generated basic EnergyPlus inputs
 - It runs EnergyPlus 22.1 on GitHub Actions now

Still to do:

 - Add water use and tie to hot water heater
 - Add garage refrigerator
 - How about dishwasher -- check Fundamentals for modeling appliances, runtime, etc.
 - Talk with Honeywell about historical data / old emails, num heating/cooling hours per month
 - Determine if energy usage timing is reasonable
 - Revisit fireplace infiltration
 - Update these docs with information about the house geometry/properties
 - Add outputs to individual structure classes
 - Add years 2020 and 2021
 - Sometime improve roof geometry, it's OK for now
